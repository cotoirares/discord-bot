<h2> <b> Bot Administrator for Discord Server </b></h2>

This project was designed in 2021 (when I was 16) as a bot which administers the basic rules of Discord servers. It was completely personalized for one server that was organising CSGO tournaments, having functionalities such as:
<ul>
  <li>Filterin messages, blocking the inappropriate ones;</li>
  <li>Adding music from YouTube to certain voice channels;</li>
  <li>Assign roles, kick or ban certain members from the server;</li>
  <li>Generate a random bracket for a certain contest they were organising;</li>
  <li>Assign the Teams to their designated channels of communication;</li>
  <li>Custom commands, such as !rules or !social_media that were displaying the community's custom links.</li>
</ul>

Being a small project, I chose to develop it using JavaScript and Discord's portal for Developers.
